My name is Robert Megyesi.

I am a software engineer from Budapest, Hungary.

# Professional experience

I consider myself a general, all-rounded software engineer with experience in various projects, to name a few:

* Identity management solutions with Keycloak and ADFS
* BPM solution using Camunda
* Media streaming using ffmpeg
* Admin applications

# Tech stack

I am usually involved in both the backend and frontend side of the projects, however my strength lies more in the
backend.

I build my apps with **Java**, preferably on **Quarkus**.

I use other languages and technologies where it is reasonable:

* JavaScript
* Bash
