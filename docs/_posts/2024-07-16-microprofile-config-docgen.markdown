I'd like to announce a new tool I'm currently working on, the MicroProfile Config Docgen Maven Plugin.

You can use this plugin to generate an AsciiDoc documentation from the MicroProfile Config annotated classes
(@ConfigProperties) and fields (@ConfigProperty) in your project.

The tool is already usable, you can check it out on GitHub: https://github.com/rmegyesi/microprofile-config-docgen-maven-plugin
